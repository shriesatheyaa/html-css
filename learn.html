                            My Father Mr. Sampath Kumar L, (TPA ID: 4021577784), visited a DM centre in May 2020 and was
                            referred to
                            consult a cardiologist due to some abnormalities in the ECG test results. We, then, consulted a
                            cardiologist in CMC Hospital, Vellore on 14-05-2020 and advised us to take ECHO & TMT tests. He took
                            the
                            Coronary Angiogram test on 15-05-2020 as per the doctor’s advice.

                    <p>
                        Based on the results of the Angiogram, he was diagnosed with the triple vessel disease and was
                        advised
                        to undergo Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) surgery as early as possible but had to wait for
                        the
                        thyroid level to become normal as it was less than the ideal range at that time.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        After taking treatment for hyperthyroidism, my father consulted Dr. Bashi V. V. Cardiac Surgeon at
                        SRM
                        Institutes for Medical Science Hospital, Chennai on 06-06-2020 and later on 26-06-2020. After the
                        observation, the doctor advised us to plan the CABG surgery by the first week of July.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Acting on the doctor’s opinion, my father Mr. Sampath Kumar L, was admitted at SIMS hospital Chennai on
                        30-06-2020 and underwent the CABG surgery on 02-07-2020. On completion of his treatment and medical
                        observations he was discharged on 08-07-2020.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Completed claim form with the final consolidated bills and the discharge summary are herewith enclosed for
                        your reference.

                    <p>
                        Hence I request you to reimburse my father’s medical treatment expenses incurred of <strong>Rs. 4,62,370/-</strong> as early
                        as possible. Thank you.
